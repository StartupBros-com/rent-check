# rent-check rubric

Every check carries one evidence tier. Read the tier as a confidence label:

| Tier | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `[replicated]` | ≥2 independent controlled studies or measured sources agree |
| `[single-source]` | One controlled study, eval, or verified tool corpus — real but unreplicated |
| `[first-party]` | Anthropic docs/blog or platform behavior verified against the shipping product |
| `[corpus]` | Prevalence data from mining real repos — describes what exists, not what causes what |
| `[convergent-practice]` | ≥3 independent practitioner tools converged on it; no controlled test |
| `[folklore]` | Community consensus with no controlled evidence — apply as convention, label as such |
| `[measured-here]` | Verified on the operator's own harness; strongest tier when present, expires on model/CLI upgrades |

## L — Load and structure

- **L1 Load-class ranking** `[first-party]` — classify every source:
  always-loaded (root context file, unscoped rules, skill/agent descriptions,
  output styles) vs. on-invocation (skill bodies) vs. on-read (reference
  files, nested context files, path-scoped rules). Rank audit priority by
  always-loaded cost × frequency. Count deferred MCP tools at name-only cost —
  penalizing a deferred tool by its schema size is a stale heuristic.
- **L2 Derivable-content cut** `[first-party]` — flag content the agent can
  derive from the repo itself: directory layouts, dependency lists,
  architecture overviews, anything one command looks up (`--help`, package
  scripts). Keep what the environment cannot confess: gotchas, rationale,
  conventions that differ from tool defaults, "we tried X and it broke
  because Y". Corroborated: an independent controlled eval found
  LLM-generated repo overviews are the least useful content class, while
  non-inferable conventions are the only class that reliably pays
  `[single-source]`.
- **L3 Size thresholds** `[folklore]` — the 100–150-line sweet spot (one
  vendor eval) and the ≤200-line guidance (first-party) are working defaults.
  A 1,650-session RCT found *no* detectable compliance effect of file size
  from 25–500 lines (affirmative null). Flag size only as a load-cost
  finding (L1), never as a compliance claim.
- **L4 Discovery hierarchy** `[single-source]` — every load-bearing rule
  belongs in, or one link from, the root file. Measured discovery rates:
  root file ~100%, references linked from it >90%, nested READMEs ~40%,
  orphan docs <10%. Flag critical material more than one hop from root.
- **L5 Pointer quality** `[measured-here]` — a pointer earns follows by
  carrying facts plus the condition to reach it ("read X when Y"), not a bare
  path. A rich 3–5-fact abstract eliminated sub-doc reads on focused tasks in
  an informal eval `[single-source]`; a bare "see docs/x.md" gets followed
  indiscriminately or not at all. Flag bare pointers on load-bearing targets.
- **L6 Index-not-inline** `[single-source]` — for reference corpora
  (framework docs, API surfaces), a compressed path index in the always-loaded
  file plus on-demand files beat both inlining (token cost) and skill
  packaging (skills went uninvoked in 56% of eval cases and an uninvoked
  skill scored *below* baseline). Flag inlined reference corpora and
  always-relevant knowledge parked in skills.

## R — Reality (deterministic; run before judgment checks)

- **R1 Dead references** `[corpus]` — every file path, command, and script
  named in the context file must exist. Check paths against the tree,
  commands against package scripts/Makefile/justfile targets. Prevalence in
  the wild: stale references are among the commonest defects found by every
  linter in this space.
- **R2 Toolchain drift** `[convergent-practice]` — package-manager commands
  must match the lockfile present (pnpm-lock/yarn.lock/package-lock);
  named scripts must exist in the manifest. A context file praising a tool
  the repo no longer uses is worse than silence.
- **R3 Loading mechanics (Claude Code)** `[first-party]` — two trap classes:
  (a) *write-blindness*: path-scoped rules load when the agent **reads** a
  matching file, not on every tool use — a rule scoped to files the agent
  usually edits directly may never load (confirmed against official docs);
  (b) *frontmatter syntax*: the YAML-array `paths:` form has open bug reports
  of silently failing to load `[single-source — verify against the current
  CLI before flagging]`. Check both for every path-scoped rule.
- **R4 Injection surface** `[convergent-practice]` — flag instructions that
  tell the agent to fetch-and-obey external content without a trust boundary,
  blanket autonomy grants ("do whatever it takes"), and prose restrictions
  that permissions config doesn't back. Scan for secrets by pattern (report
  line + type, never the value).
- **R5 Init fossilization** `[corpus]` — a context file with exactly one
  commit since generation was scaffolded and never curated (24% of mined
  repos). Flag it; generated-and-abandoned files measured *negative* on task
  success in a controlled eval `[single-source]`.
- **R6 Emphasis density** `[first-party + corpus]` — Anthropic's own system
  prompt converged from 12 IMPORTANTs to 4 and ~7.5 emphasis keywords per
  1k words to ~1.4 across 265 versions. Density well above ~2/1k words means
  emphasis no longer ranks anything. Reference, not gate. Counting rule
  (pinned — two audits once produced 1.25/1k vs 8.5/1k on the same file by
  counting differently): ALL-CAPS whole-word tokens only (IMPORTANT, NEVER,
  MUST, CRITICAL, ALWAYS), case-sensitive, per 1k words — lowercase
  "never"/"must" is ordinary prose, not emphasis. State the rule beside the
  number in every report.

## Q — Rule quality (judgment; apply per rule/line)

- **Q1 Five-filter screen** `[convergent-practice]` — flag any rule that is:
  a *default* (the model already does it — test against the current model,
  not memory; the verdict expires on upgrades `[measured-here]`), a
  *contradiction* (conflicts with another rule anywhere in the loaded set), a
  *redundancy* (same meaning stated elsewhere), a *bandaid* (added to patch
  one bad output, not to improve outputs generally), or *vague* (two readers
  would apply it differently).
- **Q2 Removal test** `[convergent-practice]` — for each rule: would the
  agent do something observably worse without it? Sample honestly — predict
  the behavior without the rule, then check the prediction against what the
  rule adds. Lines that fail are CUT candidates; lines that fail *because a
  gate enforces them anyway* are PROMOTE-completed (prune the prose).
  For *new* lines, apply the admission bar (all three must hold): without
  the line the agent produces silently broken output, not merely suboptimal;
  the trap is not discoverable in one read pass of the code, types, or parent
  context files; and the default behavior would be wrong. Line targets are
  ceilings, not quotas — a line clearing the bar stays even at the limit.
  And a rule contradicted by newer evidence gets cut even with no
  replacement ready: stale guidance misleads where missing guidance merely
  under-informs. `[convergent-practice]`
- **Q3 Polarity** `[single-source]` — in the one controlled per-rule ablation,
  negative constraints ("do not refactor unrelated code") were the only
  individually beneficial rule class (+5.7 to +20pp); positive directives
  ("follow code style") individually hurt (−8.6 to −14.3pp). Tension to
  manage: negation research says prohibitions activate the banned concept —
  so state hard guardrails as a prohibition *paired with* the replacement
  action, and convert style directives to linters instead of prose.
- **Q4 Priming reality-check** `[replicated]` — random rule files tied
  expert-curated ones in controlled tests; structure variables tested null.
  Implication for the audit: wording polish is the lowest-value proposal
  class. Do not fill a report with rephrasing suggestions; propose load-class
  moves, enforcement, and cuts.
- **Q5 Don't-walls** `[single-source]` — long runs of prohibitions with no
  paired positive action measurably slowed work and reduced completeness in
  a vendor eval. Flag ≥10 consecutive don'ts; propose pairing each kept
  prohibition with its replacement behavior.
- **Q6 Tool naming** `[single-source]` — a tool named in the context file was
  used ~160x more than an unnamed equivalent. Check that every tool the
  operator wants used is named with its trigger condition; this is the
  cheapest steering lever found anywhere in the corpus.
- **Q7 Decision tables** `[single-source]` — for recurring either/or choices
  (library A vs B by situation), a small decision table outperformed prose
  (+25% on convention adherence in a vendor eval). Suggest only where the
  choice actually recurs.

## E — Enforcement

- **E1 Backing classification** `[convergent-practice]` — for every rule
  containing always/never/must/before/after, classify: *redundant* (a hook,
  linter, or CI gate already enforces it — prune the prose, keep a one-line
  pointer if discoverability matters), *advisory-only* (no backing exists —
  propose the concrete gate), or *backing-without-mention* (gate exists,
  prose doesn't say so — add the pointer only if the agent needs to know).
- **E2 Promotion ladder** `[first-party + single-source]` — invariants route
  to the cheapest deterministic layer that fully covers them: linter/CI for
  code shape, PreToolUse-style hooks for tool use, permission config for
  access. First-party guidance is explicit that prose cannot make a hard
  guarantee; one (unreplicated, code-unverified) study measured compiled
  enforcement at 88% constraint compliance vs 50–67% for prompt-only and
  LLM-self-review.
- **E3 Session decay** `[single-source]` — the one robust structural finding:
  compliance odds drop ~5.6% per additional generated unit within a session
  (replicated across three model/codebase cells in the same study). For
  rules that matter late in long sessions, placement in the file does not
  help (position tested null) — enforcement or re-injection are the only
  levers. Treat "put critical rules at the top" as `[folklore]`.
- **E4 Paper-tiger gates** `[single-source]` — a declared gate that never
  runs is worse than none: check that lint/test scripts referenced by rules
  are invoked by CI or a hook, run on pull requests (not only pushes to
  main), and haven't had their signal rules disabled. Read gate output, not
  just exit codes.
- **E5 Obedience telemetry** `[single-source]` — where the harness supports
  post-edit hooks, a deterministic per-rule violation ledger (relevant /
  followed / violated tallies, keyed by a content hash of the rule so
  reordering doesn't reset history) turns PROMOTE into a data decision: flag
  a rule at ≥3 violations and ≥50% violation rate. Known structural bias:
  pattern heuristics can only score prohibitions naming a concrete token —
  positive directives never register violations, so absence of violations is
  no-signal, not compliance.

## P — Portfolio (when scope includes skills, memory, agents)

- **P1 Skill triage** `[first-party]` — always-on skill cost is the
  description block, paid every session; body cost is paid on invocation.
  Audit descriptions against the one-trigger-per-branch bar; propose
  user-invoked-only (`disable-model-invocation`) for skills the agent never
  fires on its own but a human reaches for.
- **P2 Overlap clustering** `[convergent-practice]` — flag skill pairs whose
  descriptions route the same branch; two skills for one branch pay twice
  and split improvement effort. A CUT here requires consumer tracing first:
  grep the harness's skills, commands, plugins, and hooks for references to
  the candidate by name — an artifact that looks duplicated may be wired
  into a workflow the twin is not, or exist as a security property (e.g. a
  sandboxed drafter). An untraced CUT is not a verdict; record what was
  traced.
- **P3 Memory ceilings** `[convergent-practice]` — memory-index files
  converge on ~200-line ceilings across independent tools and first-party
  docs (only the first 200 lines load). Enforce the ceiling; treat the
  specific number as convention. Route the FIX, don't perform it: when
  findings call for consolidation (over-ceiling index, redundant or stale
  notes), hand off to the harness's memory-consolidation tool if one exists
  (e.g. the memory-dream plugin) instead of proposing raw note edits — a
  consolidator whose drafting step cannot write directly treats note bodies
  as untrusted input, a safety property hand-edited diffs lack. No such
  tool installed → report the findings and stop at the index level. If the
  operator asks for a hand-compacted index draft anyway, it must pass BOTH
  gates before shipping: link parity (every kept entry's link resolves;
  dropped links enumerated and matched 1:1 to MERGE verdicts) and a
  fidelity spot-check (sample ≥5 rewritten lines against their source
  notes for meaning drift — compression that changes what a note claims
  is a defect, not a saving).
- **P4 Cross-agent drift** `[convergent-practice]` — where CLAUDE.md and
  AGENTS.md (or another agent's file) coexist, diff into four buckets:
  only-in-A, only-in-B, contradiction, verbatim-duplicate. Agent-specific
  divergence is expected; contradictions and drifted duplicates are findings.
  Edit symlink sources, never through the link.

## M — Monorepo layering (multi-file trees)

Run this family whenever the tree holds more than one context file. The
governing fact: **resolution semantics are per-agent**, so audit against the
agent(s) the repo actually uses (quotes and sources: EVIDENCE.md).

- **M1 Placement** `[single-source each, convergent direction]` — root holds
  only universal, non-inferable conventions; module conventions live in the
  module's own file. Measured: module-level files beat root-level
  cross-cutting guidance, ~100–150 lines per module file. Splitting is a
  load-class and team-scoping move, never a compliance move — the RCT tested
  single vs. split vs. nested directly and found null compliance differences.
- **M2 Child-file admission** `[convergent-practice]` — a child file earns
  existence only when its subtree owns conventions the root should not bill
  to everyone. Depth heuristic: root + one file per top-level package covers
  almost every real monorepo; reaching for a fourth level usually signals
  content that belongs in a reference doc, not another context file.
- **M3 Per-agent resolution semantics** `[first-party, verified]` — Claude
  Code: root and ancestor files load in full at launch, subdirectory files
  load on demand when files there are read, and everything CONCATENATES —
  nothing overrides. Codex: one file per directory from project root down to
  cwd, concatenated with nearer files later in the prompt, capped at 32 KiB
  (`project_doc_max_bytes`) — and the cap truncates the MOST SPECIFIC files
  first in deep trees. The agents.md convention says "closest file wins,"
  but nested discovery is a Codex-specific extension, not base spec
  `[single-source]`. Consequence: a child rule meant to override a parent
  must SAY so ("overrides root rule X: ...") — position alone is not
  portable, and in Claude Code's additive model there is no override at all.
- **M4 Parent-child coherence** `[first-party mechanics + convergent-practice]`
  — diff every child against its ancestor chain into three buckets:
  *restatement* (duplication — in additive loaders it double-loads the same
  meaning), *contradiction* (a defect, not an override: in additive loaders
  both versions load and neither wins), and *declared deviation* (fine —
  the child names the parent rule it varies and why; the design-rails
  brand-scope pattern: explicit per-subtree scope declarations over
  implicit position).
- **M5 Exclusion mechanics (Claude Code)** `[first-party + contested]` —
  `claudeMdExcludes` exists (glob patterns, merges across settings layers,
  managed-policy files exempt) for skipping other teams' subtree files.
  Docs state it also excludes matching rules files, but open issues dispute
  rules exclusion working in practice — verify against the current CLI
  before recommending it for rules.
- **M6 Codex-specific footguns** `[single-source, 2 corroborating]` —
  `AGENTS.override.md` is a same-directory FULL REPLACE (not a merge) and
  is git-tracked by default: an override left behind silently disables the
  file it shadowed for every teammate. In deep trees, check combined doc
  size against the 32 KiB budget — the leaf your monorepo most needs is the
  first thing truncated.
